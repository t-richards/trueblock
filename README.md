# TrueBlock

The simple website blocker which blocks websites and reminds you why you blocked them.

This extension is a heavy-handed blocker whose purpose is to block entire domains. If you want more granular blocking control, we recommend using a different tool.

## Usage

First, visit the site you wish to block.

Then, click the extension icon (`T` for "TrueBlock") next to the address bar to open the extension.

The popup page will show the domain of the current tab. This is the domain that will be blocked.

Optionally, you may enter a reason for blocking the domain. In the future, the extension will show a notification when the domain is blocked, and it will show you this reason to help you remember why you blocked it.

Finally, click the "Add site to blocklist" button to block the domain.
