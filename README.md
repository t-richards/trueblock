# Ethical Blocker

The ethical :tm: website blocker which blocks websites and reminds you why you blocked them.

This blocking utility is a heavy-handed, paint-with-a-broad-brush blocker whose purpose is to block entire domains. If you want more fine-grained blocking options, we suggest you use uBlock Origin instead.
